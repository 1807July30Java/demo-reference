            Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things.
            But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being
            able to express yourself to others through painting. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or
            tried to plan it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Trees grow however makes them happy.

            You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Get tough with it, get strong. In your world you have total and absolute
            power. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you
            ever start. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here.
