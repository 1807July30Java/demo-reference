            Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let's do that again. Be brave. A beautiful little sunset. We don't need
            any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. And right there you got an
            almighty cloud. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Get away from those
            little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. We can always carry this a step further. There's really
            no end to this. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Let's have a happy little tree in here. I guess I'm a
            little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. And
            I will hypnotize that just a little bit. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out
            of your painting and get your floor wet. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.
            Let the paint work. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Maybe there's a little
            something happening right here. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. In your world you have total and
            absolute power. Work that paint. We'll play with clouds today. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite
            is that it makes you happy. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. We have no limits to our world. We're
            only limited by our imagination. Every time you practice, you learn more. We must be quiet, soft and gentle.
            Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner.
